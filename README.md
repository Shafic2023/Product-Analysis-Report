# Adventure Works Product-Analysis-Report
In this project, I take on the work of a data analyst to build reports in Power BI showing the different 
insights,patterns and trends from the company data
Note: In this project, my role was only to create the reports with visualization as assigned by my supervisor without going into any details such as findings,recommendation and
conclusions.
I was required to come up with quick insights, real quick. The data does not violate any privacy or security issues and can be used for any purpose
